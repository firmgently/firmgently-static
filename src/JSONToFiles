{#

This file doesn't create an output of its own (because layout: false)

Instead it uses the JSON contained in the source file (./data/[items].json)
to build corresponding files for all items contained in the JSON data.

filename_pattern creates a path based on the item data. Eg:
{ type: "art", title: "painting1" }
will create ./art/painting1.html

All of those files will use the layout specified in the front-matter.

This all happens via the `metalsmith-json-to-files` plugin.
