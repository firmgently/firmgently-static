I'd suggest that the distinction between natural and man-made things is arbitrary at best, and that as we try to draw a line between the two we find that it isn't really possible or worth it. This has nothing to do with my views about what is 'good' or 'bad' in the world, or what I like or dislike. What does natural mean? Is a bird's nest natural? ![](https://gentlyfirm.co.uk/words/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IGP1376-01-300x199.jpg)What about a beaver's dam? It's made of sticks and collected items, just like a bird's nest...but it has a large effect on the area it is built in, creating a reservoir to the upstream side of it. A dam built by a beaver would seem to be an object of nature. Humans make dams too, so if a beaver dam is natural, is a human dam natural? Some would dispute this, pointing out that a human dam is made from concrete and other 'man-made' materials. Ok, but a wood wasp makes its nest from chewed up wood pulp
