You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Brown is such a nice color.

This piece of canvas is your world. Son of a gun. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow.

Take your time. Speed will come later. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Don't be bashful drop me a line. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants.

Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. Use what you see, don't plan it. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet.

We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. In your world you have total and absolute power. This painting comes right out of your heart.

You're meant to have fun in life. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things.

Let the paint work. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here.
