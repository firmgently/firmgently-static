# The Maths Myth

Why 2+2=4 is not an absolute truth, and mathematics does not exist externally to the mind of man Maths is not the language of nature, maths is the language man made to wrap around nature in order to understand it. Nature was there before man ever existed, it didn't need a language, it just did what it did. For me, the very concept of mathematics emerges from the way our minds fragment and classify the world and it is therefore not a universal absolute that exists with or without human consciousness. I know many people will disagree very strongly with this and quote philosophers in reponse, I will do my best to explain my opinion, as with all of my opinions it is subject to change if and when I encounter a better argument. My argument hinges on the idea that the universe really is all one, and if there is only one then there is no need for numbers such as 2 or 4 or anything else. If this is the case then 1 isn't a number, it's just everything that there is. Let's assume we apply the generally accepted idea of the cosmos being made up of a sea of particles (which is an abstract concept devised to help us visualise the atom if I understand it correctly - no proton or electron has ever been 'photographed'). Ok so take a cloud for example - where is its edge? From the ground it may appear to be quite sharply defined, but as you approach the cloud it will become harder and harder to define. The edge, or object boundary in this instance is set according to our visual equipment, and the thresholds our eyes and brain apply to the perception of an edge. The air is full of droplets of moisture, and where they hang together more densely we see a cloud, but there is no real edge, only a tipping point where we see the density of the droplets as being a different colour to the less dense areas. This is tied to our specific accuracy of visual equipment, for example if our eyes were more sensitive to colour variations where we now see an edge we may instead see a gradient. My point here is that the cloud exists only as a concept, a division we invent in order for our mind to segregate things off into object categories which is essential for our learning process (based on a way of thinking which, despite being the only one we know, is not necessarily the only way). If we couldn't see the edge of the cloud, we couldn't tell where the cloud ended and began, and it follows from this that we could not conceive of the cloud as it would have no definition. Basically in recognising an object we create it as a concept. I realise that this is incredibly difficult to think about and it would have to be, because the thinking equipment we have is entirely based on breaking the universe we are part of into discrete objects. It is how we internalise the world. The universe isn't made up entirely of clouds though. Or is it? Take a human being for another example. The edges of this object seem very clear and unchanging. But as most people know nowadays, the cells we are made up of die and are replaced regularly. As I sit in my chair, I may seem to be static and unchanging but in fact I am losing bits of myself as vapour, sweat, shed skin cells. I am taking gas particles into my body, and putting out other gas particles into the surrounding area. Particles are leaving and entering my cloud of a body. The language of maths will always be correct because it is the language we have created to wrap around reality as we perceive it. In this sense it would seem to be anthropic. If there is no division of the oneness of the universe (except in our heads) then there is no room for numbers as they describe collections of objects, and there are no collections, only the singular sea of existence.
