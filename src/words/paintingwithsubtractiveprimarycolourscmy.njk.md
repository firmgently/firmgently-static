How most of my paintings only use four colours  **Most of my paintings are made from a very small number of mainly primary colours.** As any child who has ever painted quickly learns red, yellow and blue can be mixed together to make secondary colours like orange and purple. With these colours and a couple of whites (titanium white for bright or opaque areas, zinc white for translucent mixes) pretty much any colour can be mixed up.

The darkest areas are actually a deep purple but they look black. Actually one of my art teachers in school forbade us from using black, justified by it not appearing in nature (although I'm guessing black holes are pretty dark). She did have a point, but she applied it too bluntly. Since then I make my own point of using pure black in some paintings, one of my justifications being [Paul Cezanne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne) (a major influence on my work) and his well-known use of blacks. In the main though, I stick to primaries and whites.

## Tonal Relativity

When there is no literal black in an image the darkest tone will tend to be perceived as a black anyway. We judge colour tones relative to their surroundings and our visual system performs a kind of automatic contrast adjustment. I like the primitive nature of only using three colours, it encourages me to get to know the properties of each pot of paint well and a limited palette helps to bring an overall coherence to a piece of work. There are problems with the approach though, some hues can be difficult to mix and it's easy to end up with muddy dull colours. This is partly because there is no such thing as a perfect pure pigment and some manufactured paint colours end up being naturally stronger than others.

## Pigmental Imbalances

For example the Deep Pthalo Blue that I like to use is very strong so I have to use a tiny amount of it relative to other colours. If I want a medium green, rather than mixing 1 part blue to 1 part yellow (which ends up as dark blue with a very slight hint of green) the ratio tends to be more like 10 parts yellow to 1 part blue. Apart from anything else this can end up being uneconomical because adding too much strong blue to a colour can make it far too blue and mean I need to counterbalance it with large amounts of the weaker colours, which equals wasted paint.

## Cryla Subtractive Primary Colours

I was running low on a couple of colours and due to buy some new paint when I found out that Daler and Rowney's decent [Cryla range](http://www.daler-rowney.com/content/cryla-range) (scroll down to read about the primaries on that link) had a primary (C)yan, primary (M)agenta and primary (Y)ellow. These are the subtractive primaries used in CMYK or process printing. People who are into printing will be more than familiar with these colours but for those who aren't, cyan is a kind of sky-blue and magenta is a pinky-purple (approximately). Yellow is yellow. Whereas painters are used to mixing red with yellow to create orange, blue with yellow to create green and so on, these rules don't apply any more when using cyan, magenta and yellow. In fact things are quite different and go against deeply ingrained habits. To make red, you mix yellow and magenta. To make blue you mix magenta and cyan. This is weird. 

## How They Worked Out

I've been painting since the days of [Rent-a-Ghost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rentaghost) and [Jossie's Giants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jossy%27s_Giants) so the idea of having to think in new ways about how to mix colours seemed like an interesting change and as these paints had been created specifically for primary mixing I thought it might end up working better than my old red yellow and blue method. I got myself some of these paints and grabbed a picture of a CMYK colour wheel to refer to when I got confused with the new colour-mixing rules.

After a few hours of painting and a few colours having been mixed I realised I didn't need the colour wheel and that things weren't so different. The magenta is deep enough to feel like a red, and mixing it with yellow still makes orange, just not the same type of orange I got with the old reds and yellows. Colour mixing for me is always about adding a little at a time anyway so my process barely changed; although there was a shift in the colours I was producing I didn't have a problem getting to where I wanted to be.

The colours have also been formulated to be closer to each other in strength, and while this hasn't been perfectly achieved none of them are as far out of whack as my old pthalo blue so this is also a welcome improvement. I like these paints a lot and they've now become my standard for any primary-based paintings.
