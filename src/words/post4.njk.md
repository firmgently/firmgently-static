## Lorem Ipsum?

When designers are working on something that contains writing but don't yet have the final text, they use *lorem ipsum* (a kind of nonsensical latin) as a placeholder.

While writing some code to give a rough estimate of reading time for articles on this site I was thrilled then to discover [A Happy Lorem Ipsum - Bob Ross Quotes Generator](https://www.bobrosslipsum.com). The output was such a sweet stream of consciousness that I was compelled to hang onto it, so have done so below. It even has little typos which for me only make it more human :)

You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. You have to make these big decisions. That easy. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Let your imagination be your guide.

The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.

> Just let these leaves jump off the brush Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains.
