Science presupposes that it is incomplete, ie. that there is more left to discover. If this was not true (if science already explained everything) then science would stop as there would be nothing left for it to discover. Merriam-Webster "of or relating to an order of existence beyond the visible observable universe" Cambridge Dictionary "caused by forces that cannot be explained by science" Oxford English Dictionary "(of a manifestation or event) attributed to some force beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature." 'Supernatural' means 'that which is outside (/above/beyond) nature. What is nature? It is the outside world (/cosmo) as explained by science.
