Nobody ever mocked a sheet of white paper. Minimalism is very popular in contemporary design and I think this is because it's safe and easy. Take away, take away, until all that remains is the essence...and there is nothing left to point and guffaw at. But in removing all extranaeity, character is also assassinated. It is undoubtedly true that visual design will often be more pleasing to the eye when there is less clutter and fussiness, but I feel that minimalism is too much the safe haven. If your design is basically empty there can be nothing to offend anybody, nothing 'wrong with it'. I can remember learning about De Stijl during art history lessons and being told that in Dutch, the word for 'beautiful' and the word for 'simple' are the same.
