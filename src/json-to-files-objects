{#

** all of the following happens via the `metalsmith-json-to-files` plugin **

- Use the source file (./data/[source_file].json) to build corresponding files
  for all `item`s contained in its JSON data

- `filename_pattern` creates a path based on the item data. eg:
  {
    title: "painting1"
  }
  will create ./objects/painting1.html

- Each created page recieves a `data` object containing the item's data
  (`data` can be renamed via `rename_data_to` via front matter as above)

- The created files will use the layout specified in the front-matter

- `passthrough` specifies an array of objects defining properties to be
  passed directly into the page (`from`) and how they should be renamed (`to`),
  so the following will pass `tags` and `date` to the page, keeping their names
