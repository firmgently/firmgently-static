The Cosmos is a very big (relative to me) cauliflower. Or, the structure of the cosmos is arranged into shapes similar to those we see in a cauliflower. Who's seeing shapes in the cauliflower? I am! I think the cosmos is one sheet, like a ball of paper screwed up really tightly but running in the opposite direction since the Big Bang, being... unscrewed.
