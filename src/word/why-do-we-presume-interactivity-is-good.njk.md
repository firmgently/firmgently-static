Stupid question right? We've been told since forever that adding interactivity is the way to increase engagement. There are probably numbers to back this up{???CHECK???]

Personally, I'm tired of it. When I'm surfing the web I just want to read. I just want a chunk of text &ndash; with punctuation, paragraphs and images where relevant. I want to scroll up and down at my own pace and just read. I don't want to 'click here for the next paragraph'. I don't want to watch a ten-minute video containing information that I could have read in half a minute. I just want to ingest information as transparently as possible.

I'm prompted to write this post this morning because of a website I just visited. It was linked from a thread I was reading elsewhere and was supposed to be about patients' experiences with taking medicine for mental health. At first glance it looked like a well-designed site. Somebody had designed the hell out of that thing.

The page was full of videos. I have a data limit. These videos were embedded in the Vimeo player (I like Vimeo - certainly a lot more than I like Google/YouTube). I had no idea, if I clicked to play one of those videos (at least they were polite enough to not auto-play)... I had no idea if clicking a video would use up an hour's worth of my data. Or a day's worth. Or a week's worth. There's no file-size listed, no bitrate information available, I didn't even know how long they'd be. So I'm not going to click them.
There were sidebars and buttons all over the place. 

This site was friendly enough to have provided transcripts of the videos. Underneath each video were a few lines of text, the beginning of the transcript.
