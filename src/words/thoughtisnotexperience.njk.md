im massaging my foot. it is a skeleton, muscle and connective tissue construction. it is irregularly concave at it's base with two sprung arches underneath. And as I think about this I move further and further away from the experience of the massage and towards these abstract concepts, encapsulated ideas of things which we use in our minds to remember and learn with. As an experience happens, or soon afterwards (when dreaming perhaps?) we break it down into it's component parts. What did it look like, sound like, how did it move, and most importantly which other of these abstract concepts went together to make it up, and in which ways were they connected? When 'studying' something I am in some ways moving away from a real sense of experiencing it and into an abstract 'understanding' of it. this I dissolve away the qualitative aspects of massaging my foot. the experience is spent inside my head, looking at mental images: skeleton, wire mesh, vascular system, muscles, tendons, kneejerk reaction is used frequently in the normal process of standing which is really lots of little instance of nearly falling over and then springing back to correct the imbalance. Instead of just experiencing the sensation of the two bits of flesh rubbing together I abstract away the whole experience.
