In fact the word _van_ is a contraction of _caravan_. _Caravan_ once used to refer to a large group of people carrying a lot of baggage and may have its origins in the Sanskrit word _karabhah_ (meaning 'camel'). Why listen to me though? [A Judge at the Court of Appeal has laid down some education on the matter](http://www.caravantimes.co.uk/news/people/human-interest/origins-of-the-word-caravan-revealed-by-high-court-judge-$21381619.htm). (To be reasonable: _van_ for most people nowadays does generally mean a motorised vehicle.  I tend to use it over _caravan_ mainly because it has fewer syllables - _caravan_ is quite time-consuming. When I use _'van_ meaning _caravan_ I always prefix it with the apostrophe to denote the contraction.)
