For a large part of my life when I heard the word 'faith' it immediately drew connotations of religion. For obvious reasons - the word is most often used in a religious context. Faith as a concept is actually more akin to things like love or trust though. To state the obvious, faith is the idea of believing in something without the use of evidence or logic. This is why the commonly-used arguments against religion which ask for evidence of God make no sense - you can't use science in place of faith any more than you can use faith in place of science - they serve different purposes. You cannot prove faith any more than you can prove you love somebody. You can *demonstrate* that you love somebody. You can be consistent about acting loving towards somebody for your entire life; but this would not prove that you love them. It's perfectly possible to not love somebody but to act convincingly as if you do. I am not a religious person by the way. Faith is very close to 'trust' in this sense. The trust one person has in another can never be based on analysis, evidence or logic.
