{#

** all of the following happens via the `metalsmith-json-to-files` plugin **

- Use the source file (./data/[items].json) to build corresponding files
  for all `item`s contained in its JSON data

- `filename_pattern` creates a path based on the item data. eg:
  {
    type: "art",
    title: "painting1"
  }
  will create ./art/painting1.html

- Each created page recieves a `data` object containing the item's data
  (`data` can be renamed via `rename_data_to` via front matter as above)

- The created files will use the layout specified in the front-matter

- `passthrough` specifies a property to be passed directly into the page,
  so the following will pass tags to the page to that other plugins can
  use them in the same manner as normal front matter tags
  {
    type: "art",
    title: "painting1",
    tags: "art,painting,one"
  }

#}
