# Lowest Power Lighting

I'm still working on reducing my power demands. Getting all of my 'leccy from the sun and living at a latitude of about 50 degrees means I often run out of power by evening, especially during the shorter, darker days of winter. ![](/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CameraZOOM-20170910003125714_edited-768x1024.jpg)I can handle things like laptops and screens running out, but having no light is harder to deal with. When it gets dark outside at 4:30pm and your indoor lighting goes out a couple of hours later (and it's cold!) it becomes pretty hard to stay motivated. Also you bump into things a lot. So I've been looking into cheap, simple ways of making sure I always have access to lighting, even when my main leisure batteries (which the solar panels charge each day) run out. ![](https://gentlyfirm.co.uk/words/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CameraZOOM-20170910000151417-1024x768.jpg)Thankfully, we're living in the LED era. LEDs are amazingly efficient - the power/brightness balance is really good. Also, the technology is [constantly improving](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/app-notes/index.mvp/id/1883) and ridiculously cheap. I've settled (for now) on a combination which works really well for me. [PIC OF LED WHITE AND WARM] These little USB LED sticks are very bright and smoothly dimmable via a simple touch-mechanism ('smooth' meaning they fade up and down smoothly rather than in steps - so you have a lot of control over exactly how bright they are). They are also available in a 'warm' option. One of the not-so-nice things about a lot of LED lamps is that they are often very white, which is quite harsh and uncomfortable especially in the evenings. The warm version provides a much nicer kind of light which feels more like traditional indoor lighting. These sticks cost about £3 each (at time of writing) on eBay in the UK but by putting up with a long wait and buying them direct from China I was able to get 5 for less than £3 in total - literally pennies apiece. I also bought 5 of the white version - as mentioned above the light isn't as cosy, but it's great for painting or any work where colour is important (the yellow/warm light causes a distortion in hue which means if you paint under yellow light at night you're in for a mildly depressing surprise when you look at your painting in the morning daylight and realise all the colours are wonky). [PIC OF BATTERY HOLDER] Another silly-cheap item, these battery holders are made for 18650 cells (they look similar to AA batteries but are a bit bigger and can be found inside old laptop batteries). I salvaged 6 of these from a ruined laptop (I fried the motherboard with my slack electrical skills - I'll save that tale of woe for another time). When inserted into these holders the batteries can be charged via an extremely common micro-usb cable (pretty much all non-Apple phones and tablets use them). The LED stick can then be slotted in the top and BO! - you have yourself a bright, dimmable, warm, cheap, lovely little light.
