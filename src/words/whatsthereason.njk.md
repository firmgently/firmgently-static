One of the biggest flaws in human reasoning is the way we presume that every observable phenomenon has a single specific cause. It ties in with our justice systems. Who is to blame? This person OR that person? EXAMPLES: "I am curious, what is the unique selling point of Unity which makes people stick to it? Is it a global menu[1]? Dock? Support of legacy indicators?"
