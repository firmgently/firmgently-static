## Controlling data usage is becoming something of a dark art Firstly, it's something that is less often necessary than it was in the days of dialup. Everybody has fast internet now! Web developers presume everybody is on unmetered broadband and desperately needs to see their carousel of huge JPEGs at no less than 95% quality. App developers feel they must be pumping out updates every couple of weeks just in case the users become too comfortable with their interfaces (OK I'm being facetious, some updates are important of course eg: security fixes). Advertising networks merrily squirt dozens of megabytes of tracking data into your internet boots with every step you take. None of these people have an interest in helping you control your data usage. Is it even possible to enjoy today's world of connectivity on a limited data connection? I currently survive on a very limited budget. The trailer I call home might end up anywhere in the country (UK for now). I'm aiming to move away from the grid as much as I can, step-by-step. For these reasons my current connection method is mobile broadband, using a new PAYG SIM every month. My favoured deal for the past year or so has been the 10GB EE SIMs available on eBay for £7-9 (the price fluctuates by a few pennies each month). For this I get 10GB of data on the EE network for 30 days. EE has a decent network which covers most of the UK with either 4G or 3G. 3G is actually ample for the way I use the internet. I get a lot of enjoyment from the internet. Be it through reading, listening to audio, interacting on social media or even watching the occasional video, a large proportion of my entertainment makes use of the internet and therefore: data. I'm a geek, I like to write code and have it backed up in a remote git repository. I'm a Linux user and love to experiment with new applications and keep existing apps up-to-date. I'm enjoying all of this usage for around £8/month, with no contract and without sharing a significant amount of personal info with an Internet Service Provider (as I have a brand-new SIM card every month). I've had to make some adjustments to my habits and this post will describe what I've done in case it might be helpful for other people with similar needs.   ## Use Linux OK this is not for everybody but I happen to use and love Linux. I'm currently using Microwatt OS which is Ubuntu-based with a focus on being slim and having low power demands (electricity, like data, is a precious and limited resource for me). It comes with the i3 tiling window manager which is fun and efficient.
